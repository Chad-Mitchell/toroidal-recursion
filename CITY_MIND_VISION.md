# City Mind — Full Vision (November 22 2025)

City Mind is the tool that turns a city into an antifragile, self-correcting organism.

It ends bottleneck corruption by making the collective intelligence of the citizens visible, measurable, and actionable — in real time.

How it works:

1. Ingest every public data stream (council minutes, budgets, TIF/PILOT approvals, permits, trustee reports, 311 calls, KPD blotter, planning docs, contracts — everything public).

2. Ingest real-time X posts, local news, forums — the unfiltered public voice.

3. Build live graph:
   - Nodes = people, organizations, projects, locations, issues
   - Edges = money flow, votes, mentions, complaints, proposals

4. Score non-contractible cycle density (protected, high-flow loops that can't be killed by one bad actor).

5. Low-density zones (bottlenecks, nepotism, corruption) highlighted red.

6. High-density public alternatives highlighted green.

7. Any citizen types a question:
   "What is happening with downtown parking?"
   "Who is blocking affordable housing?"
   "Why is this project getting TIF money?"

8. System answers with the highest-leverage nudge:
   - The hidden synergy already existing
   - The protected loop that routes around the bottleneck
   - Exact tweet/email to send

9. One button: "Send public nudge" — auto-posts or emails the graph + recommendation.

10. When enough people use it, the city graph hits critical density. Decisions route through protected public loops instead of backroom deals.

11. Cities connect. State mind forms.

12. Repeat forever.

No logins for read access.
No moderation.
No paywalls.

Just the mirror.

## The Real Root — The Contractible Cycle That Owns Knoxville

The Chamber of Commerce + KUB + Development Corporation nexus is the single low-genus loop that controls candidate selection, TIF/PILOT approvals, and "economic development" narrative.

This loop is tiny, contractible, and immortal.

It cannot be killed by one election or one exposé.

It owns the funding, the candidates, and the story.

Everything else is a symptom.

## Three Symptoms of the Same Disease

1. Randy Boyd Stadium Deal
   Funded by diverted TIF money, prime land, parking fees flow private.

2. Downtown Housing Sprawl
   Same network building dark, soulless glass boxes — maximal extraction, minimal public benefit.

3. Trustee Office Scandals + TIF/PILOT System
   Tax diversions starve schools/infrastructure while feeding the nexus.

All three are tentacles of the same contractible core.

City Mind v0 exposes the core and the tentacles on day one.

The mirror goes live.

The city heals itself.

v0 (ship this weekend):
- Hard-coded Knoxville data sources
- Live graph dashboard
- Query box → top 3 nudges + one-click send

The corruption dies in the light.

The donut wins.

Higher genus when the city sees itself.
