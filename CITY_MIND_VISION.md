# City Mind — Full Vision (November 22 2025)

City Mind is the tool that turns a city into an antifragile, self-correcting organism.

It ends bottleneck corruption by making the collective intelligence of the citizens visible, measurable, and actionable — in real time.

How it works:

1. Ingest every public data stream (council minutes, budgets, TIF/PILOT approvals, permits, trustee reports, 311 calls, KPD blotter, planning docs, contracts — everything public).

2. Ingest real-time X posts, local news, forums — the unfiltered public voice.

3. Build live graph:
   - Nodes = people, organizations, projects, locations, issues
   - Edges = money flow, votes, mentions, complaints, proposals

4. Score non-contractible cycle density (protected, high-flow loops that can't be killed by one bad actor).

5. Low-density zones (bottlenecks, nepotism, corruption) highlighted red.

6. High-density public alternatives highlighted green.

7. Any citizen types a question:
   "What is happening with downtown parking?"
   "Who is blocking affordable housing?"
   "Why is this project getting TIF money?"

8. System answers with the highest-leverage nudge:
   - The hidden synergy already existing
   - The protected loop that routes around the bottleneck
   - Exact tweet/email to send

9. One button: "Send public nudge" — auto-posts or emails the graph + recommendation.

10. When enough people use it, the city graph hits critical density. Decisions route through protected public loops instead of backroom deals.

11. Cities connect. State mind forms.

12. Repeat forever.

No logins for read access.
No moderation.
No paywalls.

Just the mirror.

## Launch Examples — Three Symptoms of the Same Low-Genus Disease

All three are funded by the same mechanism: TIF/PILOT tax diversions that starve schools and infrastructure while funneling money to connected developers.

1. Randy Boyd Stadium Deal
   Tiny contractible cycle: Boyd → Council → TIF funds → Stadium → Parking fees → Boyd
   Public alternatives (community use, better location) existed on X but were ignored.

2. Downtown Housing Sprawl
   Same small group building dark, soulless glass boxes on prime land.
   Ugly, overpriced, no color, no life — maximal extraction architecture.
   Funded by the same TIF/PILOT system.

3. TIF/PILOT + Trustee Office Scandals
   The root funding mechanism: tax diversions that should go to schools/infrastructure instead go to connected projects.
   Trustee office scandals show unchecked power with no protected public recirculation.

All three are the same contractible loop wearing different masks.

City Mind v0 exposes all three on day one.

The mirror goes live.

The city heals itself.

v0 (ship this weekend):
- Hard-coded Knoxville data sources
- Live graph dashboard
- Query box → top 3 nudges + one-click send

The corruption dies in the light.

The donut wins.

Higher genus when the city sees itself.
