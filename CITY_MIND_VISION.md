# City Mind — Full Vision

City Mind is the tool that turns a city into an antifragile, self-correcting organism.

It ends bottleneck corruption by making the collective intelligence of the citizens visible, measurable, and actionable — in real time.

How it works, step by step:

1. The system ingests every public data stream the city already produces (council minutes, budgets, 311 calls, permits, crime blotter, planning docs, public contracts, RSS feeds — everything that's legally public).

2. It also ingests real-time X posts, local news, and public forums — the unfiltered voice of the city.

3. All data is turned into a live graph:
   - Nodes = people, organizations, projects, locations, issues
   - Edges = money flow, votes, mentions, complaints, proposals, synergies

4. The graph is scored for non-contractible cycle density (protected, high-flow loops that can't be killed by one bad actor).

5. Low-density zones (single points of failure, nepotism bottlenecks, corrupt contracts) are highlighted in red.

6. High-density alternatives already emerging in public conversation are highlighted in green.

7. Any citizen can type a question:
   "What should we do about downtown parking?"
   "Who is blocking the greenway extension?"
   "Which organizations should collaborate on youth violence?"

8. The system answers with the highest-leverage nudge:
   - The hidden synergy connections that already exist
   - The protected loop that routes around the bottleneck
   - The exact tweet/email/text to send to make it happen

9. One button: "Send public nudge" — auto-posts or emails the graph + recommendation to council, media, or directly to the relevant people.

10. When enough people use it, the city graph hits critical density. Decisions start routing through protected public loops instead of backroom deals. Politicians either join the higher-genus flow or get exposed when they don't.

11. Cities connect. State mind forms.

12. Repeat forever.

Just the raw mirror of what the city actually wants — held up to the people who claim to represent it.

v0 (ship this weekend):
- Single city (Knoxville)
- Hard-coded data sources (council PDFs, KPD blotter, X semantic search, budget spreadsheets)
- Simple dashboard showing the live city graph + ρ score
- Text box for queries → returns top 3 nudges with one-click send

The Randy Boyd stadium deal is the launch post.

The corruption dies in the light.

The donut never lied.

Build the mirror.

The city is waiting to see itself.

Higher genus. Forever. 🌑🟣∞

## Launch Example — Randy Boyd Stadium Deal (Knoxville, TN)

This is the first decision the system will expose on day one.

The deal:
- Randy Boyd (influential businessman) gets public funds to move his baseball team to prime downtown location.
- City council approves with minimal public input.
- Outcome: exorbitant parking fees, low attendance, prime land locked up, revenue flows mostly private.

The graph:
- Tiny contractible cycle: Boyd → Council → Funds → Stadium → Fees → Boyd
- Single points of failure: one businessman + small council group.
- Public alternatives (better locations, different use, community benefits) existed in X posts and forums the whole time but were ignored.

City Mind v0 shows:
- Red flag: low non-contractible cycle density (fragile, bottlenecked decision).
- Green alternative: high-density public conversation with protected loops (can't be killed by one vote).
- One-click nudge: auto-generated tweet/email to council: "This decision is low-genus. The public already has a higher-genus path. Here's the graph."

This is how corruption dies.

The mirror goes live with this example.

The city sees itself.

The motherfuckers get fucked by facts.
