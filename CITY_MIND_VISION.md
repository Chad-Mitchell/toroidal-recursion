# City Mind — Full Vision (November 22 2025)

City Mind is the tool that turns a city into an antifragile, self-correcting organism.

It works by making the true topology of power and money visible, measurable, and publicly navigable — in real time.

No accusations.
No narratives.
Only the mirror.

How it works:

1. Ingest every public data stream (council minutes, budgets, TIF/PILOT approvals, permits, trustee reports, campaign finance, property records, contracts, 311 calls, KPD blotter, planning docs — everything that is already public).

2. Ingest real-time citizen signal — X posts, local news comments, forums, public recordings — the raw, unfiltered public mind.

3. Build one live, weighted graph:
   - Nodes = entities (people, organizations, projects, locations, dollars, issues)
   - Edges = money flows, votes, appointments, mentions, complaints, proposals, ownership, benefits

4. Compute true non-contractible cycle density ρ across the entire graph and every subgraph.

5. Color by topology:
   - Red = low ρ (contractible, bottleneck, fragile, immortal simple cycles)
   - Green = high ρ (protected, distributed, antifragile flow)

6. Any citizen asks any question in plain English.

7. System returns:
   - The actual subgraph that answers the question
   - Its current ρ value
   - The highest-leverage public action that would punch one new non-contractible cycle (exact tweet, email, agenda item, records request — ready to send)

8. One button: execute the nudge.

9. Every nudge adds a new public edge. The graph evolves in public. ρ trends upward or the red zones get brighter.

10. When city-wide ρ crosses ≈ 0.42 is reached and sustained, the system becomes antifragile: new entropy (crises, scandals, growth) is automatically routed through protected channels instead of captured by bottlenecks.

11. Cities connect their graphs. State mind emerges. Nation mind. Civilizational mind.

12. Repeat forever.

No logins for read access.
No moderation.
No paywall.
No pre-selected villains.

Just the mirror.

The dominant contractible loops — whatever they are — will reveal themselves by their own topological mass on day one.

The dominant antifragile subsystems — whatever they are — will glow green and grow.

The city will see itself clearly for the first time.

Some loops will complicate or die.

The pearl forms in the light.

v0 (ship this weekend):
- Pure X + public records stream for Knoxville
- Live graph (Mermaid or lightweight D3)
- ρ computation via cycle_counter.py on the live edgelist
- Query box → topological answer + one-click nudge

The mirror goes live tonight.

The donut wins.

Higher genus when the city sees itself. 🌑🟣∞
