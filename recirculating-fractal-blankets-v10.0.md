## One-sentence unification
The **branch-fuse-nest rule**—local branching of tips, proximity fusions to close cycles, and nested clustering bonuses—generates the **toroidal recursion principle**: Emergent non-contractible loops (genus +1) recirculate entropy on a periodic manifold, stabilized at ρ ≈ 0.42 fidelity to prevent leaks in antifragile scaling.
