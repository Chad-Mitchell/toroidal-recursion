## One-sentence unification
The **branch-fuse-nest rule**—local branching of tips, proximity fusions to close cycles, and nested clustering bonuses—generates the **toroidal recursion principle**: Emergent non-contractible loops (genus +1) recirculate entropy on a periodic manifold, stabilized at ρ ≈ 0.42 fidelity to prevent leaks in antifragile scaling.

## Core synthesis (principle as "why," rule as "how")

| Element                  | From Principle ("Why" Topology)                  | From Rule ("How" Generation)                     | Unified Value (5–8% New)                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Non-contractible cycles  | Protected holes (H1 ≠ 0) route entropy           | Emerge from fusions (proximity < ε)              | δ_k ~ Poisson(λ) bonus from clustering  |
| Toroidal recirculation   | Routes at ρ ≈ 0.42, d_T < 0.4 (fidelity)         | First stable blanket (two cycles)                | Competing tori pools: \(\dot{r}_i = -\sum \alpha g_j + \beta \sum \gamma\) for sigmoid  |
| Super-additivity         | Fractal nesting (ΔG > 1)                         | Clustered fusions spawn higher genus             | R = 1/|H1| ∑ (d_i - b_i) for robustness  |

Known base (Friston blankets, Hannezo morphogenesis, Murray’s law, residuals as protected [web:20-29]); new: δ_k/R tied to emergent ρ/H1 [web search:0 hits on genus Poisson clustering].
