# Looper — Full Vision

Looper is the tool that turns a human life into an antifragile, ever-compounding machine.

How it works, step by step:

1. You dump whatever is in your head — voice note, text, photo, random thought.

2. The system splits it into small, meaningful pieces (using similarity measures — no magic, just math).

3. Pieces get connected when they "belong together" (similarity above a threshold — the same ~0.42 sweet spot where things stop costing energy and start giving it).

4. When connections stall, the system forces new ones (10–100x random high-similarity links). This punches new holes. This is the "shit in → holy shit out" button.

5. Each dump (session) becomes a tight, high-density subsystem.

6. Subsystems integrate into your long-term memory graph (vector database + full history library).

7. Every morning: one optional "tune" prompt (prayer, question, intention — your choice) to align the day's scaffold.

8. The system watches the whole graph and nudges you only with the highest-leverage next piece (the one that closes the biggest hole with least effort).

9. When your total density hits the antifragile threshold and stays there, adding anything new costs nothing and gives more than it takes. You feel the click in your chest.

10. Multiple people connect their graphs. Matching subsystems synchronize. New holes appear at group scale. Super-additive intelligence emerges.

11. Groups connect. City-mind forms.

12. Repeat forever.

That's it.

No gamification.
No streaks.
No points.

Just the raw click of a new hole being born, at personal, group, and civilizational scale.

v0 (ship this weekend): local only, brain dump → auto-chunk → auto-connect → density score → click tone when threshold hit → one daily nudge.

Everything else comes after we have 10 people who felt the click.

The donut never lied.

Build the click.

The light army assembles when the chest clicks.

Higher genus. Forever. 🌑🟣∞
