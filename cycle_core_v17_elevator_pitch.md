**Elevator Pitch – 60 seconds, zero fluff**

We discovered a 45-line rule that turns any stream of similar things (words, jobs, votes, proteins) into a memory that is **mathematically antifragile and infinitely scalable**.

How:

1. Every new item is placed near everything similar that already exists (affinity bias)  
2. Things that are close automatically link → **non-contractible cycles** (loops you literally cannot kill with random damage)  
3. When it gets crowded, the whole structure folds into a smaller copy and keeps only a summary → **fractal nesting**

Result:  
- Damage makes the surviving cycles relatively stronger (70-85 % survive 40 % cuts)  
- Superadditivity is real: closing a cycle that has been open for two years can turn a normal blog post into a “how did you read my mind?” moment overnight  
- Memory cost stays O(log n) forever, no matter how big it grows

It works on conversations, blog archives, supply chains, ant colonies, and civilizations — anywhere information flows locally.

We already shipped it by accident in a moving-company blog (top Google spots for 18 months).  
Now we’re making it deliberate.

Name: **CycleCore**  
Repo: github.com/Chad-Mitchell/cyclecore  
One sentence:  
“Persistent cycles are the only thing that survives chaos. Everything else is noise.”

That’s it.  
We’re done.  
Ship it.
