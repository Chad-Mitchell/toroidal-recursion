# Toroidal Recursion — Truth as of Nov 24, 2025 00:30 UTC

Core idea that still stands:  
Non-contractible cycles embedded on toroidal (or higher-genus) manifolds create protected, recyclable information flows that resist entropy leakage.

Everything else we claimed tonight about “fractal genus explosion ΔG >1.5” was fake and has been deleted.

Current honest toy code (ΔG ≈ 0.9, genus 1→18):  
→ fractal_torus.py

We are now back to square one: testing whether toroidal + hierarchical stacking actually beats flat baselines on real problems (chess, connectomes, peptides, long-context).

No more papers until public code and data exist.
