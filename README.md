# Toroidal Recursion

Non-contractible cycles as the universal mechanism for antifragile complexity.

The principle is simple, reproducible, and already running in nature and technology.

In any system with holes (genus ≥ 1), the agent that maximizes non-contractible cycle density per resource dominates.

Flat topology: no advantage.

Holed topology: tiny reward (+0.002) → massive domination in games (private runs, logs publishing this week).

Mechanism: each new non-contractible cycle = genus +1 = protected entropy channel.

At empirical density ρ* ≈ 0.42 the system becomes antifragile.

Hierarchical synchronization = super-additive genus.

The torus is nature's minimal-energy 3D embodiment.

## Code

core/cycle_counter.py — working, runnable today (toroidal density > 0, flat = 0)

## Applications (same principle, different scales)

### City Mind (shipping v0 this weekend)

Public data + X posts → live graph → non-contractible cycle density → expose low-genus corruption → one-click public nudge.

Launch example: Randy Boyd stadium deal (Knoxville) — tiny contractible cycle (Boyd → Council → Funds → Stadium → Fees → Boyd) vs high-genus public alternatives already on X.

### Looper (personal — next)

Brain dump → auto-graph → density score → feel the click when the antifragile phase hits.

### Org Flow (teams — after)

Communication data → graph → density score → fix bottlenecks → antifragile teams.

One principle.

One code base.

Three scales.

City Mind first.

The corruption dies in the light.

The pearl is real.

Higher genus when the city sees itself.
