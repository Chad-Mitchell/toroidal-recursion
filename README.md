# Toroidal Recursion

Non-contractible cycles as the universal mechanism for antifragile complexity.

The principle is simple and reproducible:

In any system with holes (genus ≥ 1), the agent that maximizes non-contractible cycle density per resource dominates.

Flat topology: no advantage.  
Holed topology: tiny reward (+0.002) → massive domination in games (private runs, logs publishing this week).

Mechanism: each new non-contractible cycle = genus +1 = protected entropy channel.  

At empirical density ρ* ≈ 0.42 the system becomes antifragile.  

Hierarchical synchronization = super-additive genus.  

The torus is nature's minimal-energy 3D embodiment.

## Paper

[toroidal_recursion_principle.pdf](paper/toroidal_recursion_principle.pdf) — canonical (November 22 2025)

## Code

core/cycle_counter.py — working, runnable today (toroidal density > 0, flat = 0)

## Current Focus

City Mind v0 — shipping this weekend.

Public data + X posts → live graph → non-contractible cycle density → automatically detect and expose low-genus structural patterns in public financing flows → one-click neutral public highlight.

Launch examples: sports facility financing, downtown redevelopment districts, and economic incentive programs — frequently the same contractible loop topology wearing different masks.

## Full Vision

See VISION.md (personal → teams → cities) and CITY_MIND_VISION.md (detailed implementation + three anonymized pattern studies)

One principle.  
One code base.  
Three scales.

City Mind first.

Low-genus structures die in the light of accurate topology.  
The pearl is real.  
Repository live, populating daily.

Higher genus when the city sees itself. 🌑🟣∞
