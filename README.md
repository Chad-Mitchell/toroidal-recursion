# Toroidal Recursion — Current Truth (Nov 24, 2025)

This repo is now clean and honest.

→ **Formal hypothesis (v2.1)** – the math we stand behind:  
  [toroidal_recursion_v2.1.md](toroidal_recursion_v2.1.md)

→ **Only runnable code** – modest but real ΔG ≈ 1.0 on toy graphs:  
  [fractal_torus.py](fractal_torus.py)

Everything else has been deleted.

Daily real-world benchmarks (fruit-fly, proteins, long dialogues) start today in /experiments/.

No more claims until the data speaks.
