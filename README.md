# Update: Nov 26, 2025

NOTE: this repo will be archived as the core idea is further progressed. Once to a stable place, and if not abandoned outright, I'll update the repo on X. 

These are personal colab notes with Grok. It hallucinates a lot (please ignore loose analogies/metaphors). Main objective is to iterate on a core idea: a universal design primitive for scalable antifragility.

The current snapshot of work is: [Cycle Core v17](cycle_core_v17.md) and the associated notes file: [Cycle Core v17 - Where We Are Synthesis](cycle_core_v17_where_we_are_synthesis.md) (Includes addendum notes and follow up questions / clarifications)

*** Note, the versioning is chronological and iterative for tracking only. Eventually this repo will be abandoned when core ideas are crystalized further. Name / ideas / etc. are subject to change like the wind. The core idea is the invariant.
