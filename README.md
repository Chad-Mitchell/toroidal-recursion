# Toroidal Recursion Principle — LIVE v2 (November 23, 2025)

**Current paper (the one that actually reflects what we know today):**  
→ [toroidal_recursion_v2.md](toroidal_recursion_v2.md)  ← READ THIS FIRST

**Old v1 paper (kept only for historical record):**  
→ toroidal_recursion_v1.pdf (November 18, 2025 — superseded)

**Core code (40 lines):**  
- fractal_torus.py ← the actual engine  
- cycle_counter.py ← v1 legacy, still useful

**Live experiments (Nov 23–30, 2025):**  
→ /experiments/nov2025_swarm (daily commits coming)
