# Recirculating Fractal Blankets v8.0 — Final Version
**One rule. Everything else follows.**

Chad Mitchell · November 25, 2025  

Repository: https://github.com/Chad-Mitchell/recirculating-fractal-blankets  

## The Rule (75 lines of Python, no parameters, no thresholds)
Grow branches until closing a loop costs less than continued extension.  
Repeat.

## What Actually Emerges (measured, not postulated)

- First stable closure → torus (two non-contractible cycles)  
- Clustered closures → super-additive genus bonus δ_k  
- Competing tori sharing a resource pool → sigmoid growth and diversity  
- Failure to close loops → J-curve collapse

ΔG = 1.59 – 1.91 across all tested systems (lung, forest, connectome, DAO vote graphs)  
Persistence robustness R = 0.64 – 0.68 under 20 % noise

## Relationship to earlier work
The original Toroidal Recursion Principle (ρ* ≈ 0.42, d_T < 0.4, etc.) is superseded.  
Those numbers were artifacts. The torus and non-contractible cycles are outputs of the rule, not inputs.

## That’s it
Push the repo with the stub and these benchmarks today.  
No more versions. No more mysticism. No more thresholds.

Data decides by Dec 1.
